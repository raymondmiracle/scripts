## To setup build environment

Firsly, install `git`, using whatever package manager has.

Then, run these commands

```
For the Ubuntu/mint based distributions:
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChalapathiRevanth/build_scripts
cd build_scripts
. setup/ubuntu1604linuxmint18.sh
```

If running Arch Linux, please enable multilib, and install yaourt, before running the script :)
Please choose the name dependending on the distro you have =)

Enjoy!
